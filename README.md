# Clicky Game

For this assignment, I created a memory game with React and Game of Thrones Characters. The application required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The premise of the game it to select as many characters as you can without choosing the same one twice as they move around the page after each click.

I used React, Javascript, HTML, CSS to create the page.

Here is the deployed link!
